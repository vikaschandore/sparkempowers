                      The European languag are member of the same family. Their
                      separate existence is a myth. Europe same science, music,
                      sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages
                      only differ in their grammar, their samepronunciation and
                      their most common words.

                      Everyone realizes why a new common language would be
                      desirable: one could refuse to necessary have uniform
                      translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to
                      have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more words. If
                      several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting
                      language is simple and regular than that of the individual
                      languages. The new common language will be more simple and
                      regular than the existin languages samepronunciation and
                      their most common words.
